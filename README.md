## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt how to center cards in different ways,was also able to position the profile picture on top of the background card and also learnt how to position background SVG images as you want and can be linked in the css code instead of using html img reference.




### Continued development

I would like to take more of frontend mentor's challenges pertaining with HTML and CSS to improve my coding skills with HTML and most especially CSS. 



### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72167149/why-is-justify-content-center-of-my-css-code-not-working) - This helped me to understand how to center the card in different ways. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Front-End Mentor](https://frontendmentor.slack.com/archives/CCYHFT85B/p1652445926488529) - 
I was able to correct some minor errors in my coding so it will be easy for screen reader to understand my code.
